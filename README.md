# Perfectly Organized Offline Pre-install (P.O.O.P)

Prepares an offline server for installation:

- Check kernel verison if it is supported
- Copy files and check MD5
- Mounts the disks: will mount the disks accordingly (if SSD, mount on /ssd, if HDD mount on /storage etc...)
- Enable Networking: enable nic + netplan
